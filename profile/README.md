## PASTELJUNKPUNKS

This is just an art project which originated from Tallahassee, Florida in early 2023. It is inspired by a relatively obscure and/or underground online artist named Pastel Junk (or KOTA) from their distinctive art style, and we aim to expand upon this style.

On top of this, we also focus on music, games and videography. Eventually at some point, we might create some artwork and animations in the future.

This readme is very rough so things will be changed from time to time.
